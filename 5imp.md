# Adventuring

## Using Abilities

A DM may call for an ability check any time you try to do something that an average person might have a tough time doing.

Roll a d20, the DM sets the difficulty of the roll (the below are guidelines).

* DC 5 = Easy
* DC 10 = Medium
* DC 15 = Hard

### Advanced Mode

Use "Create Your Own" to make your character. Roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifier(s).


# Combat

Each time a creature attacks, roll a d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the target's AC, the target takes 1 damage. If a "20" is rolled, the roll is a critical hit. Roll a d6; the target takes that much damage instead of the normal 1.

If a creature reaches zero hit points, it is knocked out until it is revived or for the rest of the combat.

# Monsters

*SRD Conversion: Subtract 5 from listed ACs, hit points become the number of hit dice*
