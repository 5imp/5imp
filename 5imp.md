## SRD5-based rules you can play with 3-year-olds. Or drunks.

5imp is intended to be a set of lightweight guidelines to introduce tabletop roleplaying games. A game master (GM) can use 5imp to run System Reference Document 5.0 (SRD5)-compatible adventures with players of varying ages and cognitive capacities.

# Adventuring

## The Basics

1. Each player tells the GM what his or her character wants to do.
2. The GM may ask a player for an *ability check*.
   - The GM specifies which ability: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
   - The GM (privately) sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the ability check, using the below as a guideline
     + DC 5 = Easy
     + DC 10 = Medium
     + DC 15 = Hard
     + DC 20 = Very Hard
3. The player rolls a d20. If a character has "Adventuring Advantage" for the ability, the player rolls two d20 and uses the higher number.
4. The GM describes what happens based on the outcome of the ability check.

## Advanced Play

See "Using Ability Scores" in the SRD for additional adventuring rules and guidelines.

# Combat

## Initiative and Turns

At the start of combat, one player rolls a d20, and the GM rolls a d20 for the monsters. All creatures on the side with the higher number take their turns first (in any order), then creatures on the other side takes their turns (in any order), and so on until combat ends.

## Attacks

Each time a creature attacks, roll a d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the target's AC, the target takes 1 *damage* (losing 1 hit point). If a "20" is rolled, the roll is a *critical hit*. Roll a d6; the target takes that much damage instead.

## Getting Knocked Out

If a creature reaches 0 hit points, it is knocked out until it is revived (e.g. via healing) or for the rest of the combat.

## Advanced Play

See "Actions in Combat" in the SRD for additional actions beyond attacks in combat.

# Monsters

Each monster has an *armor class* (AC; the number to hit it) and *hit points* (HP; how much damage it can take). Additionally, some monsters can make multiple attacks in a single turn.

## Bulette

AC 12, HP 9

## Chimera

AC 9, HP 12, 3 attacks

## Imp

AC 8, HP 3

## Tyrannosaurus Rex

AC 8, HP 13, 2 attacks

## Adult Red Dragon

AC 14, HP 19, 3 attacks

## Ghoul

AC 7, HP 5

## Frost Giant

AC 11, HP 12, 2 attacks

## Gnoll

AC 11, HP 5

## Goblin

AC 10, HP 2

## Grick

AC 9, HP 6

## Grimlock

## Skeleton

AC 8, HP 2

## Troll

AC 10, HP 8, 3 attacks

## Xorn

## Zombie

## Advanced Play

See "Monsters" in the SRD. Convert any SRD monster by subtracting 5 from its listed AC, the number of hit dice become its hit points. The monster's number of attacks remains the same.

Adding simplified versions of special abilities will also make different monster encounters unique. Subtract 5 from DCs for saving throws.
