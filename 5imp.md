# Adventuring

The Basics:

1. Each player tells the DM what his or her character wants to do.
2. The DM may ask for an Ability Check (below)
   - The DM specifies which ability: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
   - The DM secretly sets a Difficulty Class (DC) for the ability check, which they use to describe the outcome
3. The DM describes what happens to the character(s).

## Making an Ability Check (for Players):

Simply roll a d20. If a character has "Adventuring Advantage" for the ability, roll two d20 and take the higher number.

## DC Guidelines (for DMs):

* DC 5 = Easy
* DC 10 = Medium
* DC 15 = Hard

## Advanced Play

Create your own character, including ability scores. See "Using Ability Scores" in the SRD for standard rules, or Chapter 9 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for ability score and skill variants.

# Combat

Roll two d20 (one for players and one for monsters). The side with the higher number all takes their turns first, then the other side takes all their turns, and so on until combat ends.

Each time a creature attacks, roll a d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the target's AC, the target takes 1 damage (losing 1 hit point). If a "20" is rolled, the roll is a critical hit. Roll a d6; the target takes that much damage instead of the normal 1.

If a creature reaches 0 hit points, it is knocked out until it is revived or for the rest of the combat.

Adding simplified versions of special abilities will make different monster encounters unique. Subtract 5 from DCs for saving throws.
