# Terminology

* AC (Armor Class): How hard something is to hit
* DC (Dfficulty Class): How tough a task is to accomplish

# Gameplay

## Using Abilities

A DM may call for ann ability check any time you try to do something that an average person might have a tough time doing.

Roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifier (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdomr, Charisma)

* DC 5 = Tricky
* DC 10 = Challenging
* DC 15 = Hard

*SRD Conversion: Subtract 5 from ability check DCs*

## Combat

Each time a creature attacks, roll a d20. If the number rolled is equal to or greater than the target's AC, the target takes 1 damage. If a "20" is rolled, the roll is a critical hit. Roll a d6; the target takes that much damage instead of the normal 1.

If a creature reaches zero hit points, it is knocked out until it is revived or for the rest of the combat.

# Character Building

You can build a character according to the rules specified in the SRD, or simply assign ability scores and pick a class below.

## Ability Scores

Use the standard array (8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15) to assign -1, +0, +1, +1, +2, +2 modifiers to skills your character may be good (or not so good at).

## Equipment

Equip your characters as you see fit, and subtract 5 from their calculated AC.
